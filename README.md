# notion-inspired-appflowy-theme

A premium dark Red & Black theme for AppFlowy inspired by the Notion aesthetic. This theme features a custom sidebar color palette and a unified "Light Red" glow for hovers and selection states, designed to enhance focus and provide a modern, high-contrast workspace.

## Key Features

* **Deep Dark Interface**: Utilizes a `0xFF111111` surface for the editor and a slightly lighter `0xFF1A1A1A` for the sidebar to create visual depth.
* **Vibrant Accents**: Employs pure Red (`0xFFFF0000`) for primary UI elements and buttons.
* **Enhanced Hover Feedback**: Features a custom `0x33FF5252` light red highlight for menus and settings, replacing standard grey hovers.
* **Optimized for Linux**: Specifically configured to work with the AppFlowy Flatpak build on Fedora/Linux environments. [cite: 2025-12-31]
